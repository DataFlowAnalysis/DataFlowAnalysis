## 📝 Description
This diagram illustrates the first case study in the paper, which briefly describes a system focused on component testing. The diagram shows the flow of data between the different components in the system such as the **Simulator** which generates test data for the components. After this data is simulated with the components, the measurements are stored and made visible for the user.
