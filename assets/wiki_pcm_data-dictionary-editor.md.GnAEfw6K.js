There is usually no reason to change the generated identifier. After the identifier, there can be multiple enumerations and characteristic types.</p><p>Enumerations start with the keyword <code>enum</code> followed by a name. The actual values contained in the enumeration are enclosed by curly brackets. Individual keywords are separated by at least one whitespace character such as a single whitespace or a line break. An enumeration holding the colors red, green and blue would look like follows:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>enum Colors {</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Enum characteristic types use enumerations to specify their possible values. Such a characteristic type starts with the keyword <code>enumCharacteristicType</code> followed by a name for the type. The used enumeration is specified by the keyword <code>using</code> followed by the name of the enumeration. A enum characteristic type describing background colors would look like follows:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>enumCharacteristicType BackgroundColor using Colors</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>Avoid to change the order of characteristic types or deleting a characteristic type after a characteristic type has been used in a system. Otherwise, the internal references between the system and the dictionary will break and everything that made use of a characteristic type needs to be recreated. Instead of removing a characteristic type, change the name or don&#39;t use the characteristc type anymore. New characteristic types can always be added.</p></div>`,15)]))}const f=a(c,[["render",d]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
