The allocation diagram consists of the resources already specified in the resource environment and the system parts, of which the system consists.
The system parts are the assemblies used while creating the system model using the [Assembly Editor](/wiki/pcm/assembly-editor.md).
Assemblies are located within the resource containers to visualize their deployment onto the corresponding resources.
