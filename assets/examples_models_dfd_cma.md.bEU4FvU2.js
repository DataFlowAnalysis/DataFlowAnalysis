The diagram is based on the code from the study, in which the nodes show different functionalities and labels show decorators that the functions had. This application contains functionalities such as submitting manuscripts, assigning reviewers to the manuscripts (so that they become accepted papers), recommending papers, searching for papers, etc. The diagram also shows the added components for privacy policies and consents implemented in the app, which was one of the main focus of the paper.</p><h2 id="🔤-abbreviations" tabindex="-1">🔤 Abbreviations <a class="header-anchor" href="#🔤-abbreviations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🔤 Abbreviations&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>None</li></ul><h2 id="📖-extensive-description-if-possible" tabindex="-1">📖 Extensive Description (if possible) <a class="header-anchor" href="#📖-extensive-description-if-possible" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;📖 Extensive Description (if possible)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The left side of the diagram shows the user entering its <em>credentials</em> (<em>email</em>, <em>username</em>, and <em>password</em>) into the <strong>Flask App</strong>. From here on there are 2 possible flows of data, which depend on the user being already registered or not. In both flows the <em>credentials</em> flow to the <strong>Login Flask</strong> or <strong>Register Flask</strong> nodes. Afterwards in the login case the <em>credentials</em> flow to the <strong>Check Credentials</strong> node where they are checked and consequentially to the <strong>SQLite DB</strong> node. In the case of the registration flow the <em>credentials</em> flow to the <strong>After Register Hook</strong> and finally to the <strong>SQLite DB</strong>. From this node there are many data flows which are forwarded to the <strong>Current User</strong> node, from where they will flow to their respective functionality nodes. Starting from the top there is the flow of <em>candidate_reviewers</em> data to the <strong>Show Candidate Reviewers</strong> node which forwards it to the <strong>Calculate Conflicts</strong> node. Directly beneath the <em>manuscripts</em> data is forwarded to the <strong>Retreive Manuscripts</strong> node which then forwards it to the <strong>Calculate Conflicts</strong> node, which makes sure that given the <em>manuscripts</em> and the <em>candidate_reviewers</em> there are no conflicts of interest (a reviewer reviews its own paper). From this node the list of <em>candidate_reviewers</em> flows to the <strong>Assign Reviewer</strong> node, which does the reviewer assignment. Then the &quot;ready to review&quot; manuscript flows to the <strong>Review Papers</strong> node. Once the manuscript has been reviewed it flows to the <strong>Save To DB</strong> node where it is saved as a (not yet accepted) <em>paper</em>. Continuing with the flows from the <strong>Current USer</strong> node, it sends the <em>user_consents</em> data to the <strong>Policy</strong> node which forwards it to the <strong>Privacy Template</strong> where the user its able to see its current consent settings. In the next flow <em>user_consents</em> flow to the <strong>Remove Consents</strong> node, which then forwards the <em>actualize_consents</em> to the <strong>Save To DB</strong> node. Accordingly the next one is again the forwarding of the <em>user_consents</em> to the <strong>Add Consents</strong> node, which forwards the <em>new_consents</em> to the <strong>Save To DB</strong> node. Next, on the lower side of the diagram from the <strong>Current User</strong> node, there are flows from an (accepted) <em>paper</em> to the <strong>Retrieve Recent Papers</strong> node and <strong>View Paper</strong> node. The first one then forwards the <em>paper</em> to the <strong>Calculate Recommendations</strong> node which then forwards it to the <strong>Recommend Papers</strong> node and lastly to the <strong>Recommend Papers Template</strong> where the user can recommend a certain paper. In the case of the <strong>View Paper</strong> node it also receives a <em>paper_request</em> data from the <strong>Search Papers</strong> node and forwards the <em>paper</em> to the <strong>View Paper Template</strong> where the user can read the paper. The last flow from the <strong>Current User</strong> node is regarding the <em>reviewed paper</em> data (manuscript which has been reviewed) which flows to the <strong>Accept Paper</strong> node. Here the reviewed paper is accepted and flows (as <em>accepted_paper</em>) to the <strong>Save To DB</strong> node. Lastly there is a last node called <strong>Submit Manuscript</strong> which sends a <em>manuscript</em> to the <strong>Save To DB</strong> node.</p><h2 id="🏷️-label-description" tabindex="-1">🏷️ Label description <a class="header-anchor" href="#🏷️-label-description" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🏷️ Label description&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>Its important to notice that in the code, and thus in the diagram a manuscript is a paper which has not been reviewed.
