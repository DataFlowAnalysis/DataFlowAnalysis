# xDECAF Tooling 
The xDECAF data flow diagram analysis constraint framework provides several frameworks to interact with the analysis:

The [Online Editor](/wiki/onlineeditor/) that allows for modelling [Data Flow Diagrams](/wiki/dfd/) online and provides functionality to analyze them as well. 

The [Command Line Interface](/wiki/cli/) that allows you to run the analysis within an binary locally.

Or the [analysis frameworks](/wiki/development/running-locally) for both [Data Flow Diagrams](/wiki/dfd/) and the [Palladio Component Model](/wiki/pcm/)

Lastly, the provided [Converter](/wiki/development/converter) allows for conversions between several models and allows using more models for the analysis.
