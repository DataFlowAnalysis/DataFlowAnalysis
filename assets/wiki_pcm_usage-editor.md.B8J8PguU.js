The effect of a call on quality properties is specified by so called variable usages. A variable usage describes how a variable, which can essentially be a parameter or return value, is characterized. The variable is defined by a name shown in the top of the grey rectangles that visualize variable usages. The definition of characteristics shown below the name can refer to other characteristics, which enables the propagation of characteristics through the system.</p><p>Call actions allow to specify two types of variable usages: usages for parameters of the called service (i.e. characterizations of the sent parameters) and usages for the return value of the called service (i.e. characterizations of the received return value). To specify characteristics for a parameter, the variable usages has to have the very same name as the parameter in the signature of the called service. To specify characteristics of the return value, a variable usage with any name can be defined. However, when referring to the characteristics of the particular return value from the called service, the keyword <code>RETURN</code> has to be used.
