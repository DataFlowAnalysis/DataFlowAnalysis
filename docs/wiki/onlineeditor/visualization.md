# Visualization options
The OnlineEditor allows for visualizing the cause for individual constraint violation as well as choosing incoming/outgoing/all labels for the annotations.

## Label Mode
By default the annotations show the labels incoming on the annotated Node. Note that this is per TFG, so if a node is part of multiple TFGs the same label might be shown as incoming multiple times.

Under Settings -> Show Labels it is possible to select another annotation method. Outgoing Labels shows all labels propagated by the Node, while All Labels shows both incoming and outgoing labels.

## Constraint Selector
By default all constraint violations are shown. The OnlineEditor has to option show select individual constraints which will highlight the TFG on which the violation has occurred. 

In the constraint menu, click the kebab menu in the top right corner to select one/multiple constraints for visualization.
