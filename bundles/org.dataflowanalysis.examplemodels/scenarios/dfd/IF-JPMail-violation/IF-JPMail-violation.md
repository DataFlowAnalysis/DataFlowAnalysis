## 📝 Short Description

This model describes a mail exchange via public mail server.

## 🔤 Abbreviations

- **Policy DS**: Policy DataStore
- **Bob DS**: Bob DataStore
- **SMTP**: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- **POP3**: Post Office Protocol Version 3

## 📖 Extensive Description
(In this discription you may use/are encouraged to use __Vertex Names__ and *Variable/Edge Names* so that the reader may follow the flow)

The case is about __Alice__ who sends a mail to __Bob__ via a public mail server. Initially, Alice provides an *email_body_and_header*, which is split into header and body. The body is encrypted (__encrypt__) with the public key of Bob (*BobPubKey*). Header and encrypted body are sent via mail servers to __Bob__. __Bob__ decrypts the body in the `Decrypt` zone and reads the mail. 

## 🏷️ Label Description
### 🗂️ Data Labels:
- **Level**: This label denotes the zones a data flow may access. There are levels `High` and `Low`.
- **LevelBeforeEncryption**: This label stores the security classification of a data flow before it is encrypted with the `declassify` node. This can be `High` or `Low`.
### 🏷️ Node Labels:
- **Zone**: There are two `Zones`: `Trust` and `Attack`. A node can be in either or none of these `Zones`.

## ⚠️ Constraint
### SafetyConstraint
The fundamental requirement is that system parts or actors in the attack zone must not have access to data classified High:
- `data Level.High neverFlows vertex Zone.Attack`

## 🚨 Violations
The error introduced in the case is that the email body is not encrypted anymore but transmitted directly. The mail servers now have access to the plaintext of the mail body.
