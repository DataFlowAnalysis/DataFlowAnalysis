# Getting Started with xDECAF
The extensible data flow diagram constraint analysis framework (xDECAF) is a data flow analysis that uses input models, like [Data Flow Diagrams](/wiki/dfd/), to determine whether the components described in that model adhere to constraints formulated by users of the analysis.

## Installation
### Using our Online Editor <Badge type="info">Recommended</Badge>
The Data Flow Analysis can be run fully inside a browser, no additional setup required.
You can model your system using our online representation of [Data Flow Diagrams](/wiki/dfd/) and formulate constraints via our [DSL](/wiki/dsl/).

For more information see the [Online Editor Wiki Section](/wiki/onlineeditor/)

### Running Locally
Should you wish running the analysis locally, you need to decide which development environment you wish to use:

#### Eclipse 
Using our analysis is easy using the provided eclipse product from the [Downloads Page](/download/#eclipse-product-recommended)
After that you can follow the [Eclipse Setup Guide](/wiki/eclipse/)

#### IntelliJ
Our analysis can be used inside of IntelliJ as well, albeit with some more required setup.
Follow the instructions outlined in the [IntelliJ Setup Page](/wiki/intellij/)
