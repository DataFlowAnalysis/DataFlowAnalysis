These suggestions only work if the action that contains the variable usage and therefore also the assignments is correctly integrated into the usage or control flow.</p><h2 id="syntax-of-assignments" tabindex="-1">Syntax of Assignments <a class="header-anchor" href="#syntax-of-assignments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Syntax of Assignments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Assignments assign truth values to triples of variable, characteristic type and value. If the value is <code>true</code>, the given value of the given characteristic type is available on the variable. If there is no assignment for a triple or the truth value is <code>false</code>, the given value of the given characteristic type is not available on the variable. If there are multiple assignments to the same triple, only the last assignment is effective.</p><p>The syntax of an assignment is <code>variable.characteristicType.value := Term</code>, where <code>Term</code> is a term that yields a truth value. The <code>variable</code> is always the variable defined by the variable usage. The <code>characteristicType</code> is one particular characteristic type from the data dictionary. The <code>value</code> is one value from the enumeration that defined the value range of the characteristic type. The supported types of terms are the following:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Term Type</th><th>Syntax</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Constant</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Constant</td><td>false</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Negation</td><td>!Term</td><td>!false</td></tr><tr><td>Binary Logic</td><td>Term &amp; Term</td><td>false &amp; true</td></tr><tr><td>Binary Logic</td><td>Term | Term</td><td>false | true</td></tr><tr><td>Characteristic Reference</td><td>variable.characteristicType.value</td><td>RETURN.color.red</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A characteristic reference on the right hand side of the assignment can refer to available variables. Such variables typically are parameters or return values. By referring to other variables, the assignments specify a propagation of characteristics.</p><p>To simplify specifications, it is possible to omit the characteristic type and the value from characteristic references on the left hand side als well as on the right hand side of an assignment. To omit an element, the asterisk <code>*</code> can be used in the particular location. If the characteristic type is ommited, the value needs to be ommited as well. Additionally, elements on the right hand side of an assignment can only be ommited if these elements are ommited on the left hand side of the assignment as well.</p><p>Assignments containing omissions will be instantiated with appropriate values during runtime. If you omit a value but specify a characteristic type having <code>n</code> values, there will be virtually <code>n</code> assignments. In assignment <code>i</code> for <code>0 &lt;= i &lt; n</code> there will be the value with index <code>i</code> be inserted in all places, in which a value has been omitted. If the characteritic type and the value have been omitted, there will be an assignment for every tuple of characteristic type and values of this characteristic type.</p><h4 id="example" tabindex="-1">Example <a class="header-anchor" href="#example" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example&quot;">​</a></h4><p>To illustrate the effect of omissions, let&#39;s assume there are the two characteristic types <code>ForegroundColor</code> and <code>BackgroundColor</code>, which use the same enumeration specifying the colors <code>Red</code>, <code>Blue</code> and <code>Green</code>. The variable <code>out</code> is specified and can refer to a variable <code>in</code>. The following examples show how omissions are handled for this particular example.</p><p>If only the value is omited, ensure that the used characteristic types have compatible value ranges. The value ranges are compatible, if the characteristic types refer to the same enumeration. This implies that the value ranges are the same. The meaning of the following example is that the foreground color of the output variable shall have the background color of the input variable.</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>out.ForegroundColor.* := in.BackgroundColor.*</span></span></code></pre></div><p>becomes</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>out.ForegroundColor.Red := in.BackgroundColor.Red</span></span>
